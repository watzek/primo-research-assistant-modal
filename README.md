![Research Assistant Modal](screenshot.png "Research Assistant Modal")


A concern with Primo Research Assistant (Primo's AI chatbot) is that it only indexes CDI content. This may not be clear to users. 

This Primo VE customization creates a modal/popup when users visit the Research Assistant. The text of the modal can be customized within the `template` portion of the Angular module in custom.js.
